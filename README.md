# mips-simulator

A minimal implementation of a Multi-cycle MIPS Simulator. It is not intended to be used for production use.

It accepts a pseudo-object file, which is a file consisting of multiple 32-bit words, separated by a newline.
The program assumes the file is valid. Comments may be defined in a line starting with `#`.

## Building The Simulator

Run `make clean; make all`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It has been tested only on Linux.

- The `clock` of the CPU is stored at [`src/units/control/control.c`](src/units/control/control.c#L19)
- The `Î¼PC` of the CPU is stored at [`src/units/control/control.c`](src/units/control/control.c#L19)
- The microcode for the instructions is stored at [`src/units/control/microcode.c`](src/units/control/microcode.c#L11)
