# mips-simulator

A minimal implementation of a Multi-cycle MIPS Simulator. It is not intended to be used for production use.

It accepts a pseudo-object file, which is a file consisting of multiple 32-bit words, separated by a newline.
The program assumes the file is valid. Any line starting with `#` are treated as comments, and are ignored.

## Building The Simulator

Run `make clean; make all`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It has been tested only on Linux.

### Running The Simulator

Run `./mips_simulator pseudo-object-file stats-file`.
For example: `./mips_simulator tests/1_math_test.o ./math_test.stats`
